Hi, I'm Dan Munteanu. Below you will find a few of the things I created.

## My Best Repo's:
- [Raytracer Unilight](https://github.com/danmunteanu/RAYTRACER_UNILIGHT) - A simple raytracing app written in C# for Windows desktop
- [MemphisNow](https://github.com/danmunteanu/MEMPHIS_NOW) - An app written in C++ and Qt to rename mp3 files in a visual way
- [SaveMoon](https://github.com/danmunteanu/SAVE_MOON) - A very simple C# app to archive saves folder for No Rest For The Wicked (Breach Refined). *I wrote this because sometimes the game fails or might corrupt the saves.*

- [Links](https://github.com/danmunteanu/LINKS) - A personal collection of bookmarks I've gathered from my online explorations

## Software Development:
Basically I'm into object-oriented programming. 
I have professional experience with both desktop and web development. 

### For desktop application development, I use 
- C# with .NET Core to create WinForms apps

### For web development, I use:
- Laravel with PHP as the foundation for my web apps
- Vue.js for building web UIs
- Filament for server-side UI rendering
- Tailwind or Bootstrap for layouts and styling
- three.js for creating 3D web apps
